how to run a file ⁠ a.sil?
    -> open terminal and go to the compiler directory.
    -> run "make" in the terminal.
    -> run the compiler executable in the "bin" folder with the a.sil as the command line argument
        for example: run " ./bin/compiler [location of the test cases]/a.sil "


Where am I generating compiler binary and mips executable?
    -> the executable will be in the same location from where the compiler is called.("pwd⁠" present working directory )


How much of assignment 4 I have done?
    -> all of it


Screenshot of AST
    -> the image is in the compiler folder



Screenshot of symbol table in the terminal 
    -> the image is in the compiler folder 
    (i am not executing the code while compiling. thats is why all the variables in the symbol table have value 0,
    I have already shown the symbol table after executing the code for assignment 3 which was correct.)

    -> the image is in the compiler folder
